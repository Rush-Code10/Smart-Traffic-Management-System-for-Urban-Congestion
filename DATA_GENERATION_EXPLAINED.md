# Data Generation in Smart Traffic Management System

## **Overview**

The Smart Traffic Management System generates data at multiple levels to simulate a realistic traffic environment. Since we don't have access to real traffic cameras and sensors, the system creates synthetic but realistic data that mimics real-world traffic patterns.

---

## **Data Generation Layers**

### **Layer 1: Vehicle Detection Data (Bottom Layer)**
**What:** Individual vehicle detections from "cameras"
**Where:** `src/processors/traffic_simulator.py`
**How:** Synthetic vehicle generation with realistic patterns

### **Layer 2: Traffic State Data (Aggregation Layer)**
**What:** Processed traffic conditions (counts, queues, wait times)
**Where:** `src/processors/traffic_aggregator.py` + Dashboard components
**How:** Aggregates vehicle data into traffic metrics

### **Layer 3: Performance Data (Analytics Layer)**
**What:** System performance metrics and trends
**Where:** Dashboard components and demo scripts
**How:** Calculates KPIs and generates historical patterns

### **Layer 4: Prediction Data (AI Layer)**
**What:** Future traffic forecasts and AI decisions
**Where:** `src/processors/prediction_engine.py` + RL agents
**How:** Uses historical patterns to predict future traffic

## **Layer 1: Vehicle Detection Data**

### **Traffic Simulator (`traffic_simulator.py`)**

This is the **foundation** of all data generation. It simulates what a real camera + AI system would detect:

```python
# Realistic traffic patterns based on time of day
patterns = {
    'morning_rush': TrafficPattern(
        base_flow_rate=15.0,  # 15 vehicles per minute per lane
        peak_multiplier=2.0,  # 2x more during peak
        vehicle_type_distribution={'car': 0.8, 'truck': 0.1, 'bus': 0.05, 'motorcycle': 0.05}
    ),
    'evening_rush': TrafficPattern(base_flow_rate=12.0, peak_multiplier=1.8),
    'midday': TrafficPattern(base_flow_rate=8.0, peak_multiplier=1.2),
    'night': TrafficPattern(base_flow_rate=3.0, peak_multiplier=1.0)
}
```

**What it generates:**
- **Individual vehicles** with unique IDs (`vehicle_000123`)
- **Vehicle types** (car, truck, bus, motorcycle) with realistic distributions
- **Positions** in lanes with clustering near traffic lights
- **Timestamps** for when each vehicle was "detected"
- **Confidence scores** (85-98%) simulating AI detection accuracy

**Realistic patterns:**
- **Rush hour spikes** (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) with 2x more traffic
- **Directional bias** (more northbound in morning, southbound in evening)
- **Vehicle clustering** near intersections (traffic queues)
- **Random variations** to simulate real-world unpredictability

### **Example Vehicle Detection:**
```python
VehicleDetection(
    vehicle_id="vehicle_000123",
    vehicle_type="car",
    position=(15.2, 45.8),  # x, y coordinates in meters
    lane="north_lane_1",
    confidence=0.94,
    timestamp=datetime(2024, 1, 15, 8, 30, 15)
)
```

## **Layer 2: Traffic State Data**

### **Traffic Aggregator + Dashboard Generation**

Takes individual vehicle detections and creates **traffic conditions**:

```python
def _generate_sample_traffic_data(self):
    current_hour = datetime.now().hour
    
    # Rush hour patterns
    if 7 <= current_hour <= 9 or 17 <= current_hour <= 19:
        base_traffic = 25  # vehicles per direction
    elif 10 <= current_hour <= 16:
        base_traffic = 15  # daytime traffic
    else:
        base_traffic = 8   # night traffic
    
    return {
        'vehicle_counts': {
            'North': max(0, int(base_traffic + np.random.normal(0, 5))),
            'South': max(0, int(base_traffic + np.random.normal(0, 5))),
            'East': max(0, int(base_traffic * 0.8 + np.random.normal(0, 3))),
            'West': max(0, int(base_traffic * 0.8 + np.random.normal(0, 3)))
        },
        'queue_lengths': {
            'North': max(0, np.random.uniform(10, 50)),  # meters
            'South': max(0, np.random.uniform(10, 50)),
            'East': max(0, np.random.uniform(5, 40)),
            'West': max(0, np.random.uniform(5, 40))
        },
        'wait_times': {
            'North': max(0, np.random.uniform(20, 80)),  # seconds
            'South': max(0, np.random.uniform(20, 80)),
            'East': max(0, np.random.uniform(15, 60)),
            'West': max(0, np.random.uniform(15, 60))
        }
    }
```

**What it generates:**
- **Vehicle counts** per direction (North: 8, South: 5, East: 12, West: 3)
- **Queue lengths** in meters (how long the line of cars is)
- **Wait times** in seconds (how long cars have been waiting)
- **Signal phases** (which lights are currently green/red)
- **Confidence scores** for prediction accuracy

---

## **Layer 3: Performance Data**

### **Demo Data Generation (`dashboard_demo.py`)**

Creates **historical traffic data** for training and analysis:

```python
def generate_demo_traffic_data(components, duration_minutes=60):
    traffic_states = []
    current_time = datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=duration_minutes)
    
    for minute in range(duration_minutes):
        hour = (current_time + timedelta(minutes=minute)).hour
        
        # Realistic traffic patterns
        if 7 <= hour <= 9 or 17 <= hour <= 19:  # Rush hours
            base_traffic = 25
            congestion_factor = 1.5
        elif 10 <= hour <= 16:  # Daytime
            base_traffic = 15
            congestion_factor = 1.0
        else:  # Night
            base_traffic = 5
            congestion_factor = 0.5
        
        # Generate traffic state for this minute
        traffic_state = TrafficState(
            intersection_id='demo_intersection',
            timestamp=current_time + timedelta(minutes=minute),
            vehicle_counts=vehicle_counts,
            queue_lengths=queue_lengths,
            wait_times=wait_times,
            signal_phase='north_south_green',
            prediction_confidence=0.75 + np.random.normal(0, 0.1)
        )
        
        traffic_states.append(traffic_state)
```

**What it generates:**
- **60-120 minutes** of historical traffic data
- **Realistic time patterns** (rush hours, day/night cycles)
- **Correlated metrics** (more vehicles = longer queues = higher wait times)
- **Training data** for AI models

---

## **Layer 4: AI & Prediction Data**

### **Q-Learning Agent Data**

The RL agent generates **decision data**:

```python
# Agent observes traffic state
state = "v2_q3_w2_pnorth_south_green"  # 2 vehicles, queue level 3, wait level 2

# Agent decides action
action = SignalAction(
    intersection_id="demo_001",
    phase_adjustments={'north_south_green': +15, 'east_west_green': -5},
    reasoning="Heavy northbound traffic detected, extending green phase"
)

# System calculates reward
reward = -45.2  # Negative of total wait time (lower is better)
```

### **LSTM Prediction Data**

The prediction engine generates **forecast data**:

```python
# Predicts next 30 minutes of traffic
predictions = PredictionResult(
    intersection_id="demo_001",
    predictions=[15, 18, 22, 25, 23, 20],  # vehicles for next 6 time periods
    timestamps=[datetime + timedelta(minutes=i*5) for i in range(6)],
    confidence=0.78,
    horizon_minutes=30
)
```

## **Randomization & Realism**

### **Why Use Random Data?**

1. **No Real Cameras:** We don't have access to actual traffic cameras
2. **Realistic Patterns:** Random data follows real-world traffic patterns
3. **Consistent Testing:** Reproducible results for development
4. **Scalable:** Can simulate any intersection configuration

### **How Randomness Creates Realism:**

```python
# Rush hour traffic (7-9 AM)
base_traffic = 25
actual_traffic = base_traffic + np.random.normal(0, 5)  # 25 ± 5 vehicles

# Queue lengths correlate with vehicle counts
queue_length = vehicle_count * 2.5 + np.random.normal(0, 5)  # realistic correlation

# Wait times correlate with queue lengths
wait_time = queue_length * 1.8 + np.random.normal(0, 8)  # more queue = more wait
```

### **Realistic Patterns Built In:**

1. **Time-based patterns:** Rush hours, day/night cycles
2. **Directional bias:** More traffic from residential areas in morning
3. **Correlation:** More vehicles → longer queues → higher wait times
4. **Variability:** Random fluctuations like real traffic
5. **Special events:** Accidents, construction, events

## **Configuration-Driven Generation**

### **Intersection Configuration:**
```json
{
  "intersection_001": {
    "name": "Main St & Oak Ave",
    "geometry": {
      "lanes": {
        "north": {"count": 2, "length": 100},
        "south": {"count": 2, "length": 100},
        "east": {"count": 2, "length": 100},
        "west": {"count": 2, "length": 100}
      },
      "signal_phases": ["north_south_green", "east_west_green"],
      "default_phase_timings": {
        "north_south_green": 45,
        "east_west_green": 45
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration drives:
- **Number of lanes** per direction
- **Lane lengths** for vehicle positioning
- **Signal phases** for timing optimization
- **Default timings** for baseline comparison
