- **Phase Control:** Manually set signal phases and durations
- **Emergency Functions:** All-red signals, emergency vehicle priority
- **Deactivation:** Return to automatic control

## Configuration

### System Configuration
The dashboard uses the system configuration from `config/system_config.json`:

```json
{
  "system": {
    "dashboard_refresh_rate_seconds": 5,
    "max_signal_adjustment_seconds": 120,
    "emergency_override_timeout_seconds": 300
  },
  "intersections": {
    "intersection_001": {
      "name": "Main St & Oak Ave",
      "geometry": {
        "signal_phases": ["north_south_green", "east_west_green"],
        "default_phase_timings": {
          "north_south_green": 45,
          "east_west_green": 45
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Dashboard Customization
Key customization options:

- **Refresh Rate:** Adjust auto-refresh interval (1-30 seconds)
- **Alert Thresholds:** Modify congestion alert levels
- **Chart Colors:** Customize visualization color schemes
- **Metric Targets:** Set performance targets and thresholds

## API Integration

The dashboard integrates with all system components:

### Traffic Data
- **TrafficState:** Real-time traffic conditions
- **VehicleDetection:** Individual vehicle tracking
- **SignalAction:** Signal timing adjustments

### Control Systems
- **SignalControlManager:** Signal hardware interface
- **QLearningAgent:** Reinforcement learning optimization
- **PredictionEngine:** Traffic forecasting

### Data Processing
- **TrafficAggregator:** Data aggregation and analysis
- **ConfigManager:** System configuration management

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Operator ID required for manual override
- Action logging with timestamps and operator identification
- Session timeout for security

### Audit Trail
- All manual interventions logged
- Signal timing changes recorded with reasoning
- Export capabilities for compliance reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard won't start:**
   ```bash
   # Check dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Verify configuration
   python examples/dashboard_demo.py
   ```

2. **No intersections available:**
   - Run the demo setup to create sample configuration
   - Check `config/system_config.json` for intersection definitions

3. **Real-time updates not working:**
   - Verify auto-refresh is enabled in sidebar
   - Check system component status indicators
   - Review logs for error messages

4. **Manual override not responding:**
   - Ensure operator ID is entered
   - Check for existing override sessions
   - Verify intersection selection

### Performance Optimization

- **Large datasets:** Use data filtering and pagination
- **Slow rendering:** Reduce refresh rate or chart complexity
- **Memory usage:** Clear browser cache and restart dashboard

## Development

### Adding New Components
1. Create component class in `dashboard_components.py`
2. Add rendering methods with Streamlit widgets
3. Integrate with `SystemIntegrator` for data access
4. Add to main dashboard tabs or sidebar

### Custom Visualizations
- Use Plotly for interactive charts
- Follow existing color schemes and styling
- Add responsive design for different screen sizes
- Include data export options

### Testing
```bash
# Run dashboard tests
python -m pytest tests/test_dashboard.py -v

# Run integration tests
python -m pytest tests/test_dashboard.py::TestDashboardIntegration -v
```
